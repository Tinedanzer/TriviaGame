After making this assignment, I realized I should have made the majority of the html within javascript, in order to empty it all and recreate with new questions.

But alas, I didnt realize that until I had to make the score screen.

1) created skeleton html/css with questions buttons and forms with radio tags.

2) made it pretty

3) put most crucial things inside of an object; made functions for time, with a decrement of 1 second, and a clearInterval to stop timer when it hits 0 or if questions were answered.

4) made conditions that if the right answers were chosen, then you'd get points, and same for losses.

5)I made two buttons, one for submitting answers, and one to return to the trivia quiz after the body was emptied.

6) after Emptying the body after submitting answers, I created and styled html through javascript to append to paragraphs, creating a new web page... the score screen.
