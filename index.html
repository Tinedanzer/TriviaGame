    <h1>TOTALLY TRIVIAL TRIVIA!!</h1>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-mid-12">
<p>You are an adventurer in a room with 2 doors and 2 guards. One of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other leads to certain death --you don't know which is which.
</p><p>
  One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You don't know which one is the truth-teller or the liar either.
  </p><p>
  You have to choose and open one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to one of the guards.
  </p><p>
  What do you ask so you can pick the door to freedom?</p>
